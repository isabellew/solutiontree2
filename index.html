            <h1>PROBLEMS? WRITE IT DOWN</h1>

            <p class="boxtext">Do you experience a lack of human rights in your life? Are you, or someone near you affected negatively by structures, laws, comments, actions or norms in your community? If “no”, good for you, if “yes”, then you have come in contact with a problem. If you cannot already find your problem on the tree, feel free to submit it to us with a brief explanation. <br><br>

These are a few examples of such problems:
Corruption, hate speech, bad education, rape culture, homophobic music, racist jokes, and police brutality. 
 <br><br></p>

            <p id="undertext">“I find racist jokes a problem in my country since they reduce the issue of racism and show that it’s acceptable to be a racist as long as you’re funny at the same time. This attitude reproduces racism and makes it a part of our everyday life"</p>

                <h1>SOLUTIONS? <br> PERFECT! PLEASE SHARE WITH US</h1>
<p class="boxtext">Do you have a solution to any of the problems identified in the tree? Perhaps you’re a part of an organization working with children’s rights, maybe you know of a project promoting girl’s roles in sports, or you could just have a tip on how to tackle racist jokes. All solutions, big or small, are welcome. So if you have a smashing solution, please, share it with us! <br><br>

These are a few examples of such solutions:
A project educating the police force in non-discrimination, a blog promoting LGBT rights, not ignoring the homeless woman on the subway but instead answering her when she speaks with you. Stop being passive and instead question a friend when they’re making a sexist/racist/homophobic comment.
</p>

<p id="undertext">“When someone tells a racist joke I don’t laugh or sit quiet. Instead I challenge the person to explain what part of that joke could possibly be considered funny. When they start to explain, it’s obvious how the ‘joke’ is racist and degrading towards other people. This realization usually makes them angry or sometimes creates an awkward situation. But I much prefer awkwardness before racism.”</p>

<h1>ABOUT THE SOLUTION TREE</h1>
<p class="boxtext">Hi, and welcome to our site The Solution Tree!<br><br>


The Solution Tree aims to provide you with resolutions to different human rights violations that you experience in your day to day life. Perhaps you’re a student, or a representative for a school, an organization or a corporation. If you’re not, don’t worry, it’s more than okay to just be a human being with a big heart and a desire to help out and make a change. <br><br>

The idea for the Solution Tree was created during the International Youth Conference by Anne Frank House as a project by the Swedish participant Julia Willgård. Talking to people at the pub, in the classroom or at work, Julia discovered that most people in Sweden share the same values regarding human rights, but that there are few people actually getting involved in doing something to fulfill these ideals. The Solution Tree is a way for you to get in touch with projects/organizations/ideas in an easy and quick manner.

MENSEN conducts advocacy and the distribution of information both online, at conferences, festivals and other events mainly in a Swedish context. <br><br>

MENSEN wishes to inform, educate, create conversations and motivate thoughts about menstruation and provide a different picture of menstruation to society at large.  This means changing the negative attitudes, strengthened through silence and secrecy surrounding menstruation. To achieve this MENSEN works from a queer perspective since menstruation has nothing to do with gender identity, and informs both menstruating and non-menstruating people about menstruation, menstrual-related diseases and various problems pertaining to the subject.

                <p class="infotxt">Insamlingsstiftelsen mot trafficking (IMTR) is a national organization whose core notion is to provide direct assistance to victims vulnerable to trafficking. IMTR started in 2008 as an offshoot of the cooperation “Partnerskapet Samverkan mot trafficking” (2005-2007), which was one of the biggest initiatives ever taken in Sweden, and served as a platform for a range of activities in putting an end to human trafficking. One of the problem areas identified in the framework of this cooperation was the need for support to victims of human trafficking, which so far had been neglected. Therefore IMTR was founded. <br><br>
IMTR has ten years experience in efforts to put a stop to human trafficking and is part of a large professional network with extensive knowledge and experience with working against human trafficking. IMTR supports its victims and cooperate with both the government and civil society. The support IMTR provides is a complement to community efforts and provided based on individual needs. This may include specific actions, such as providing reading glasses, food, housing options, computers, clothes, shoes, medicine, baby clothing, prams, baby equipment, major efforts rehabilitation, education, and psychosocial support in the home country.

The vision of Brightful is that all young people should have a goal with their future, and dare to believe in their own ability. Brightful was founded in the spring of 2012 by Fatime Nedzipovska, who came up with the idea after a conference in Paris on Social Entrepreneurship in 2011. Fatime and Elnaz Barjandi, another participant in the conference and now a mentor, have together developed the framework for Brightful, concentrating on getting the participants to identify and strive towards their goals and thus shaping their own future, regardless of background and circumstances. <br><br>

The Brightful program consists of individual coaching and joint workshops where young people can get in touch with organizations, schools, businesses and local role models. An important part of the program is the mentors who coach and engage in the participants' goals and dreams. The mentors are young adults studying, running their own business, or are in other ways striving towards fulfilling their own goals.
